There are two tasks to accomplish what I want:

1. Improve task management in Thunderbird
2. Better integration with Remember the Milk

Thunderbird Task Management

*Infrastructure
-- Sub-tasks!
-- Ordering of tasks
-- Task dependencies
   -- Task B must wait until Task A is completed
      before work can start
   -- All child tasks of a task must be completed
      before a parent task can be completed
   -- More?
-- Task tags
-- Task locations
-- Better task prorities, aging, occasional feeding
-- Convert tasks to e-mail messages
   -- delegation
   -- assignment
-- Convert e-mail messages to tasks
   -- accept delegation or assignment
-- Link tasks to e-mail messages and/or messages to tasks
-- Sort/filter based on tag, location, priority, age, sequence,
   natural order, title/summary, completion %, due dates,
   today, tomorrow, this week
-- Provide sufficient back-end to support Google and RTM tasks

*UI
-- Task coloration (based on calendar? priority? )
-- Gantt chart-y stuff
-- Drag-n-Drop sequencing
-- Drag-n-Drop e-mail conversion

Integration with Remember the Milk

-- Priority mapping
-- Fix syncing with multiple lists
-- RTM lists can be events or ToDos depending on their character
-- Investigate sub-tasks
-- Test with Pro version of RTM
-- SmartList edit/creation?
-- Verify recurrences all work correctly
-- Rate limiting

Things to be done:

1. Read RFCs on icalendar, iTIP, iMIP
2. Study ical-format output of Google tasks and RTM
3. Dig into current Lightning infrastructure for iCal support

4. Install Javascript development environments
