What I want to accomplish:

1. Improve task management in Thunderbird
2. Better integration with Remember the Milk
3. Support for VJOURNAL entries

Thunderbird Task Management

*Infrastructure
-- Sub-tasks!
-- Arbirtrary Ordering of tasks
-- Task dependencies
   -- Task B must wait until Task A is completed
      before work can start
   -- All child tasks of a task must be completed
      before a parent task can be completed
   -- More?
-- Task tags/Categories
-- Task locations
-- Better task prorities, aging, occasional feeding
-- Shared task interactions
   -- Convert tasks to e-mail messages
      -- delegation
      -- assignment
   -- Convert e-mail messages to tasks
      -- accept delegation or assignment
   -- Master-list task completion sharing
   -- (Sub-)Task list instantiation from template
      -- Share task-list templates via E-mail (as a VCALENDAR)
   -- Link tasks to e-mail messages and/or messages to tasks
-- Sort/filter based on tag, location, priority, age, sequence,
   natural order, title/summary, completion %, due dates,
   today, tomorrow, this week
-- Provide sufficient back-end to support Google and RTM tasks

*UI
-- Task coloration (based on calendar? priority? )
-- Sub-task expansion with menu arrows
-- Drag-n-Drop sequencing
-- Drag-n-Drop e-mail conversion
-- Gantt chart-y stuff?

Integration with Remember the Milk

-- Priority mapping
-- Fix syncing with multiple lists
-- Multiple user accounts?
-- RTM lists can be events or ToDos depending on their character
-- Test with Pro version of RTM
   -- Investigate sub-tasks
-- SmartList edit/creation?
-- Verify recurrences all work correctly
-- Mapping RTM Tags <-> TB/L Categories
-- Mapping Location (RTM short name <-> TB/L long name?)
-- Mapping RTM Notes <-> TB/L Description/Comments
   -- Preserve properties for conversion back and forth
      (local storage?)
-- URI mapping
-- Rate limiting

Things to be done:

1. Read RFCs on icalendar, iTIP, iMIP
2. Study ical-format output of Google tasks and RTM
3. Dig into current Lightning infrastructure for iCal support

   -- https://dxr.mozilla.org/thunderbird/source/calendar
4. Install Javascript development environments
