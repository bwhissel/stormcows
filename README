StormCows
=========
A Thunderbird/Lightning extension that allows two-way access between Remember The Milk and Lightning calendar events and todos.

Requirements
------------
You'll need to install Lightning before you install this extension.

Overview
--------
Each calendar you create with StormCows corresponds to a particular list in Remember The Milk. You can choose to add a calendar either as Events or Todos.

If you choose an Events calendar, the following properties will sync:
* Task name <=> Event title
* Task due date <=> Event start date
* Task priority <=> Event priority

If you choose a Todo calendar, the following properties will sync:
* Task name <=> Task title
* Task due date <=> Task due date
* Task completion <=> Task completion
* Task priority <=> Task priority

Keep in mind that each time the calendar syncs/refreshes in Thunderbird, all calendar items are refreshed from Remember The Milk. That means properties not synced with RTM will be lost. That includes reminders, event durations, and notes.

Installation & Authentication
-----------------------------
The source code for the extension is hosted here at GitHub. To make the extension:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .zip archive of the contents
3. Rename the .zip file to a .xpi file

Alternatively, you can download a pre-made .xpi file here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqp62qtz01mjicc/stormcows-0.2.xpi

Then, to install the extension in Thunderbird:
1. Open Tools > Add-ons
2. Click Extensions at the left
3. Drag & drop the .xpi file to the extensions window
4. Follow the instructions to install the extension & restart Thunderbird
5. Open Tools > Configure StormCows...
6. Click Start Authentication
7. Leaving the authentication dialog open, login to Remember The Milk and authorize the application
8. Click Finish Authentication
9. For any lists you want to sync, select the list in the dropdown menu and click Add Events or Add Todods to create a new calendar.
10. Close the dialog. (You can come back later to add more lists, if you need.)

The Future
----------
I made this extension for personal use and, as is, it mostly works for me. I'm open to improving & expanding it if there's a demand, though.

There are some bugs and some wish-list features and I've added those as Issues here in GitHub. Feel free to comment or add new issues.
