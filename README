StormCows
=========
A Thunderbird/Lightning extension that allows two-way access between Remember The Milk and Lightning calendar events and todos.

You can download the add-on and see instructions for configuring it here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/stormcows/

Requirements
------------
You'll need to install Lightning before you install this extension.

The Future
----------
I made this extension for personal use and, as is, it mostly works for me. I'm open to improving & expanding it if there's a demand, though.

There are some bugs and some wish-list features and I've added those as Issues here in GitHub. Feel free to comment or add new issues.
