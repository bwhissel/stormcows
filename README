This is a new fork of moldybeats/stormcows, 2017-05-22. The first
goal is to make the plugin compatible with recent verisons of
Thunderbird/Lightning starting with v52.1.1/5.4.1.1. Then we'll
make further enhancements.

**DEPRECATED**
After a long period of putting off improvements to StormCows, it's
time for me to call it quits on this project. Unfortunately I haven't
found myself using Thunderbird in the last couple years so motivation
to improve the add-on has been pretty low.

If anyone is interested in continuing work on the add-on, fork at will.

StormCows
=========
A Thunderbird/Lightning extension that allows two-way access between
Remember The Milk and Lightning calendar events and todos.

You can download the add-on and see instructions for configuring it here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/stormcows/

Requirements
------------
You'll need to install Lightning before you install this extension.

The Future
----------
I made this extension for personal use and, as is, it mostly works for
me. I'm open to improving & expanding it if there's a demand, though.

There are some bugs and some wish-list features and I've added those
as Issues here in GitHub. Feel free to comment or add new issues.
