StormCows
=========
A Thunderbird/Lightning extension that allows two-way access between Remember The Milk tasks and Lightning calendar events.

Overview
--------
Each calendar you create with StormCows corresponds to a particular list in Remember The Milk. The events on that calendar correspond to the tasks in that list. You can add, edit and delete tasks from Thunderbird or from Remember The Milk.

Changes to the following properties will be synced:
* Task name <=> Event title
* Task due date <=> Event start date
* Task priority <=> Event priority

Keep in mind that each time the calendar syncs/refreshes in Thunderbird, all calendar items are refreshed from Remember The Milk. That means event properties not synced with RTM will be lost. That includes event reminders, end dates, and notes.

Installation & Authentication
-----------------------------
The source code for the extension is hosted here at GitHub. To make the extension:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .zip archive of the contents
3. Rename the .zip file to a .xpi file

Alternatively, you can download a pre-made .xpi file here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5rhb7nkdkkrxfw5/stormcows-0.1.xpi

Then, to install the extension in Thunderbird:
1. Open Tools > Add-ons
2. Click Extensions at the left
3. Drag & drop the .xpi file to the extensions window
4. Follow the instructions to install the extension & restart Thunderbird
5. Open Tools > Configure StormCows...
6. Click Start Authentication
7. Leaving the authentication dialog open, login to Remember The Milk and authorize the application
8. Click Finish Authentication
9. For any lists you want to sync, select the list in the dropdown menu and click Add to create a new calendar.
10. Close the dialog. (You can come back later to add more lists, if you need.)

The Future
----------
I made this extension for personal use and, as is, it mostly works for me. I'm open to improving & expanding it if there's a demand, though.

There are some bugs and some wish-list features and I've added those as Issues here in GitHub. Feel free to comment or add new issues.
